Problem Sets
------------

There are 6 problem sets covering the units in class. We strongly encourage students to work in teams. The final solution must be your own work.

| ASSIGNMENTS | TOPICS |
| --- | --- |
| Problem Set 1 | Order of Magnitude Estimation; Energy to Generate Electricity and to Separate CO2 from a Gas Stream; A First Order Model of a Power Plant ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/problem_set_01)) 

Some Caveats
------------

This class is about process design. One of the most important features of solutions to design problems is that the answers are typically not unique - usually there is no 'correct answer' nor is the answer in the back of the book. The design process is further complicated by missing or conflicting information, ambiguous objectives, and no clear problem statement. As a result:

*   You will have to make a lot of assumptions, **document them**, understand the implications and then move on.
*   Keep to the **time limit imposed by the units allocated to this class** - the goal is to do the best that you can in the allocated time, not to exhaust yourself. Time management is critical.
*   This is a **team** effort, plan and allocate the work across all members, meet regularly and iterate the design concepts.
